# Brain-Tumor-Segmentation
Using Magnetic Resonance Images for Identifying Tumor and Locating lesion/Benign Neoplasm.
<br><br>
Hybrid Approach is adopted which is implemented in Segementation phase.<br>
<Strong>Hybrid Approach</Strong>: <strong>K Means Algorithm</strong> + <strong>Fuzzy C Means Algorithm</strong>
<br><br>
Steps included in this process are:
<strong>
  <ul>
    <li>Pre-Processing</li>
    <li>Morphological Operations</li>
    <li>Feature Extraction</li>
    <li>Classification</li>
    <li>Segmentation</li>
  </ul>
